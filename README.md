A workout tracker.

## Why? Don't we already have enough workout tracker apps?

Yeah, but they all seem to suck. I haven't found a single workout tracker app that doesn't spam you, sell your data, ask you for exorbitant amounts of money for basic features or isn't a simply bad app.

From using Trainerize with my trainer, I've grown to despise having to open that app, as it doesn't work offline (which really sucks as my gym is in a basement), autoplays video tutorials for exercises in full-screen when you try to see your previous weights and reps, and is buggy to extremes. It does have some nice features, such as connecting with Apple Health, but the core experience itself is very much lacking. The same goes for 

However, I know how to make software. Therefore, I've decided to make an app that simply isn't trash. An app that you'll actually find useful for training - hopefully. 

I'm building this primarily for myself, but I hope other people will find it useful as well. This won't have a strong roadmap or set of features at first, as this is a hobby project. However! Any feedback and any contributions (in forms of issues, PRs, testing or feedback) are very much welcome. This includes features you'd like to see in a workout tracker.

## How will this work?

I'll be building a self-hostable, PHP-based, progressive web app that works offline. For free and open-source.

Not too sure about the stack at this point. I may offer a hosted version in the future.

## What about licensing?

The fitness industry in general isn't really as concerned with ethics as developers usually are, and I want to have a course of action if someone freeboots this project. I'm still considering various licenses, but the spirit of CC licences with restrictions on commercial usage and redistribution sits well with me. I'll update the repo with a license file when I decide upon one in the future. If I contribute code to the repo meanwhile, consider it licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 until it's relicensed.
